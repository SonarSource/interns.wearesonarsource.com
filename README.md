# interns.wearesonarsource.com

This repository supports "observation internships" done at SonarSource.

The goal of these 1-week internships is to give interns a taste of the Sonar developer experience, introducing them to collaboration, collective intelligence and Web development.

The results of previous internship sessions are saved as tags on the repository.
